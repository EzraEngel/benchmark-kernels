# Benchmark Kernel Reference Implementations

This repository contains reference implementations for the **"Beyond Entity Count"** benchmarking suite. These implementations serve as the "Gold Standard" for verifying correctness and performance baselines when using the [Simulation Test Harness](LINK_TO_HARNESS_REPO).

## Current Implementations

### 1. Unity DOTS Sensing Kernel
*   **Engine:** Unity 2022.3+ (Data-Oriented Technology Stack)
*   **Kernel Type:** Sensing (Line-of-Sight & Non-Line-of-Sight)
*   **Algorithm:** Hybrid Burst-compiled Jobs with Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) acceleration.

## Quick Start (Windows)

A pre-compiled 64-bit Windows binary is included in this repository for immediate testing with the harness.

1.  Locate the build:
    ```text
    ./DOTSBuild/Benchmark.exe -nographics -batchmode -scenarioType GEO_NO_LOS -scenarioName normal_static_no_los.md.json -scenarioPath /path/to/parent/benchmarks/geometry/normal_static_no_los/normal_static_no_los.md.json -numUpdates 100
    ```
2.  Point your harness `config.yaml` to this executable path to run the verification suite.

## Building from Source

To compile the reference implementation for other platforms (Linux/macOS) or to inspect the source code:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Unity Hub
    *   Unity Editor (Version 2022.3 LTS or higher recommended)
    *   DOTS/Entities package dependencies (automatically resolved by Unity Package Manager).

2.  **Build Steps:**
    *   Open the project directory in Unity.
    *   Navigate to `File > Build Settings`.
    *   Select your target platform architecture.
    *   Ensure the "SensingBenchmark" scene is selected.
    *   Click **Build**.

## Implementation Notes & Limitations

**Dynamic Behavior**
The current reference implementation accepts both static and dynamic configuration files generated by the harness. However, the internal update logic for agent movement is currently disabled in this build.
*   **Impact:** The simulation performs the full sensing query workload (AoI + Raycast) every tick, but agent positions remain stationary.
*   **Result:** Results for "Static" and "Dynamic" benchmark configurations will produce identical detection counts in this version.

**determinism**
This implementation uses a fixed random seed for internal logic to ensure deterministic results across runs, provided the input JSON configuration remains constant.
